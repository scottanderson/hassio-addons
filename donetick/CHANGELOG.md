## 0.1.76:
## Release Notes:

Another big one! Between the backend and the app, there's a lot in here so bare with me if I miss something, will keep updating this over the next few days.

- **Offline Mode keeps getting better**: sync + versioning support landed on the backend (new `syncVersion` field so the app can reconcile changes made while offline), and on the app side offline support now covers labels, projects, and chore archiving/unarchiving too. Also fixed stuck commands blocking the sync pipeline, spurious "you're offline" flips, and ghost chores showing up when switching accounts. Offline data now properly clears on logout/session expiry/server change.

- **NFC**: cleaned up NFC permissions on Android (removed NDEF/PACE to keep Play Store happy) and fixed NFC URL generation on iOS.

- **OCR -> Task**: you can now snap/upload a photo and have it turned into a task automatically. Still early, expect it to get smarter over the next few releases.
- **Advanced Filtering improvement** : custom filters can now group results, and filter/chip navigation no longer kicks you to a new page when running as a PWA. History and activity views also got a unified toolbar with filtering built in.

- **SSO-only self-hosting**: new `disable_password_auth` config option so you can fully disable local/password login and run SSO-only through your OIDC provider. If you're locking things down for a single-household deployment this one's for you.

- **Attachments**: new attachment browser/viewer, plus draft support so uploads don't get lost mid-edit.

- **Task creation got a refresh**: reworked Add Task modal with a smarter title input and a quicker due-date/time picker.

- **Activity & History**: new detail modal so you can drill into (and edit from) any activity entry, plus proper "Missed" / "Rescheduled" status handling and a fix for points history not counting all circle members.

- **Localization**: German, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese translations added — thank you to everyone contributing!

- **Login/Auth fixes**: fixed a Google Sign-In crash on iOS, OAuth2 refresh token bug, MFA handling improvements, and clearer error messages when login fails.

- **API validation is more graceful now**: instead of just failing, invalid requests come back with useful details on what went wrong.

- as a side note: for self-hosters without email configured, there's now a `log_raw_url` option to log password-reset links straight to the console.

## Special thanks:

- everyone who contributed translations (German, pt-BR, Japanese, zh-CN)  you're making Donetick usable for a lot more people!
- everyone who filed issues, tested betas, and helped shape this release. Thank you!

  The main view now includes a side calendar where you can easily see all your scheduled tasks (both assigned to you and others in your circle).  

- **Updated Configuration Loading**:  
  Added support for environment-specific overrides.  

- **API Support**:  
  You can now create tasks and chores via the API.  

- **Points System Upgrade**:  
  Introduced the ability to redeem points!  

- **Task in sentence**: I am excited about this one specifically. the focus is to minimize the click and field switching when creating a task. You would click the input field and type everything into one sentence. Donetick will attempt to parse the details and will show the modal to show you what has been processed
You will open Donetick. click on the top field and type the task once you are done press enter. and task created. you can set due dates, recurrent tasks, and priorities all in one shot.
> [!WARNING]
> This may cause tasks to fail to be scheduled or created properly. If you encounter this issue, please open an issue in the repository.


  **Usage:**  
  - **Priority**: For the highest priority, use any of the following keywords: `P1`, `Urgent`, `Important`, or `ASAP`.  
    Use `P2`, `P3`, or `P4` for lower priorities.  
  -  **Due date**: Specify dates with phrases like tomorrow, next week, Monday, or   August 1st at 12 pm.
  -  **Frequency/Reccurent**: Set recurring tasks with terms like daily, weekly, monthly,  yearly, or patterns such as every Tuesday and Thursday.
